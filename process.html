      <h2>Drawing Stage</h2>
        <p>I use a gridding technique to sketch out the initial drawing.</p>

      <h2>Underpainting</h2>
        <p>Next I block in the major shadows and highlights using complimentary colors.</p>
        <img src="Process_2.JPG">
      <h2>First Layer</h2>
        <p>I then paint a first layer of the actual skintone, blocking in the darkest values first.</p>
        <img src="Process_3.JPG">
      <h2>Adjustments</h2>
        <p>Unfortunately there is always something I need to fix after my first layer of skintone!
          After I took the first picture below I realized that both the forehead and chin were too narrow.
          So I adjusted those sections as you can see in the second picture below.
